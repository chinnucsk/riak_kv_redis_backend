# Hiredis C client wrapper as an Erlang NIF.

## Description

## Building and Installing

The **erl_hiredis** app is built with
[rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar), which must be in the command
`PATH`.

## Acknowledgement

I am trying to learn to write a NIF mostly by examining code from the great Steve
Vinoski; however, all errors in both code and style are obviously mine
and mine alone.
